Example of how use a stream to unzip a csv file and convert it to JSON for filtering

There's a gzipped CSV file on a server somewhere. You want to download it, unzip it, convert the CSV to JSON, then filter the JSON and perform an action on some of the objects. Use something like what you see in `index.js`

 To see the output, run `npm start`
